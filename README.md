# Car Price Estimation

This repository contains code and resources for estimating car prices using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Car price estimation is a common problem in the automotive industry and can be addressed using various machine learning algorithms. This project aims to build a model that can predict the price of a car based on its features such as make, model, year, kilometer, and condition.

## Data

The data used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Arabam.com](https://www.arabam.com/). It includes information about various cars including their make, model, year, kilometer, price, and other relevant features.

## Methodology

The car price estimation model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. The process involves:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting car prices.
3. Model training: Training the machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
5. Deployment: Deploying the model for real-time predictions or integration into applications.
