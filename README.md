Car Price Estimation
This repository contains code and resources for estimating car prices using machine learning technique.

Overview
Car price estimation is a common problem in the automotive industry and can be addressed using various machine learning algorithms. This project aims to build a model that can predict the price of a car based on its features such as make, model, year, kilometer, and condition.

Data
The data used for training and testing the model is sourced from [arabam.com]. It includes information about various cars including their make, model, year, kilometer, price, and other relevant features.

Methodology
The car price estimation model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. The process involves:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting car prices.
Model training: Training the machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Deploying the model for real-time predictions or integration into applications.
